## Issues Identified

### 1. File Structure Issues
- **Missing CSS directory**: The project expects a `css/` directory but it wasn't present initially
- **Incorrect redirect path**: `index.html` was redirecting to `pages/homepage.html` but the file is at root level
- **CSS path inconsistency**: `homepage.html` references `../css/main.css` but should reference `css/main.css`

### 2. Build Process Issues
- The build script expects `./css/tailwind.css` but the file was in the root directory
- Missing proper directory structure as described in README

### 3. Navigation Issues
- Links in navigation may not work correctly due to file structure inconsistencies
- Some pages may have incorrect relative paths

### 4. Potential Security Issues
- External script loading from `static.rocket.new`
- WhatsApp links with hardcoded numbers
- Form submissions without proper validation

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Directory Structure
- Created the missing `css/` directory
- Moved `tailwind.css` to the correct location in `css/`
- Fixed the redirect path in `index.html` from `pages/homepage.html` to `homepage.html`

### 2. Build Process
- Successfully ran `npm install` to install dependencies
- Successfully ran `npm run build:css` to compile Tailwind CSS

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. File Structure Consistency
- Update all HTML files to use consistent relative paths
- Ensure all CSS references point to `css/main.css`
- Consider organizing pages into a `pages/` directory as originally intended

### 2. Security Enhancements
- Implement proper form validation
- Add CSRF protection for form submissions
- Consider removing or securing external script dependencies

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Optimize images and add proper alt text
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Minify CSS and JavaScript for production

### 4. Accessibility Improvements
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Improve color contrast ratios

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
- Test and improve mobile navigation
- Ensure all interactive elements are touch-friendly
- Optimize layout for various screen sizes

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining path inconsistencies in all HTML files
2. Test the application in a browser
3. Implement proper form handling
4. Add error handling and validation
5. Consider implementing a proper backend for form processing
